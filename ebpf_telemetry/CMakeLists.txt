# NOTE:                                                                         #
# Due to the clever way that the EBPF programs are built, any modifications to  #
# this file can upset the CMake cache and cause upredictable building errors.   #
# To avoid this, firstly always build in a build directory, e.g.:               #
#                                                                               #
#    $ mkdir build; cd build                                                    #
#    $ cmake ..                                                                 #
#    $ make                                                                     #
#                                                                               #
# and subsequently, if the CMake cache does get upset, simply remove the build  #
# directory and start again with a fresh build directory, e.g.:                 #
#                                                                               #
#    $ cd ..                                                                    #
#    $ rm -rf build                                                             #
#    $ mkdir build; cd build                                                    #
#    $ cmake ..                                                                 #
#    $ make                                                                     #
#                                                                               #

# TIP:                                                                          #
# If this CMake file stops working, it could be because you're using a newer    #
# kernel source and the include files have moved. A simple way of finding the   #
# correct list of include directories is to modify the Makefiles in the kernel  #
# source in ${LINUX_SRC}/samples/bpf and ${LINUX_SRC}/tools/lib/bpf and add the #
# -v switch to the compiler. This will cause it to output all the switches it   #
# was called with, plus all the directories it will search for headers.         #
